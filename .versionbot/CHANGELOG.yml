      hash: 03b7b78659a70312c68c14c540e2c08e88d601cf
      body: |
        Pseudo-tty allocation uses the `script` command for setting up the
        environment, however this really only works in linux runners, meaning
        users trying to setup runs on other environments will see their tests
        fail for unrelated reasons. This makes the configuration optional
        behind a `pseudo_terminal` input.

      body: |
        The `script` command used for pseudo-tty during testing writes to
        `typescript` in the current directory by default. This may cause issues
        with some projects that do not expect new files to be generated. This
        changes the location of that file to the `/tmp` directory to avoid any
        issues.

        This wraps the shell in the steps that run `npm run test`

        and `poetry run pytest` in a `script -q -e -c` to allow tests that

        require pseudo-tty (e.g. for applications that work with terminal colors)

        to be able to operate as they would in a local dev environment.

      body: |
        By making e2e tests a manual step we can speed up Flowzone
        development and reduce noise on production repositories.

        The downside being the default tests could miss things
        but it's rare that things fail in e2e and pass in Flowzone self-tests.

        be used instead.

      body: |
        - Add sanitize inputs job
        - Rename project_types to process_source
        - Rename event_types to check_context

        This is the first of a set of commits
        to refactor large jobs into smaller components.

        This will allow more control over dependencies
        while speeding up runtime since more jobs
        can run in parallel.

      body: >
        Clippy needs to install repository dependencies before running. These

        dependencies may sometimes require external packages, which are provided

        by `cross` [pre-build hook](https://github.com/cross-rs/cross#pre-build-hook) feature.


        This PR changes the rust steps order so clippy is run using cross

        instead of default cargo.

        The test workflow will identify whether the PR is from a fork or not

        and we conditionally run either `pull_request` or `pull_request_target`

        events and skip the other to avoid duplicate workflows.


        Modifications to workflow files will be ignored for `pull_request_target`

        events by GitHub so we just need to make sure we aren't sharing secrets

        to arbitrary code.

        The `github_finalize` job was trying to use the original source of the
        PR

        for creating the release notes. This required the source artifact to

        exist at the moment of merge which is not always true as merge can

        happen at any point after creating the PR. This changes the job to use

        the latest source but exclude the last two commits (merge and version)

        from the release notes.

        to continue to force this for now and avoid breaking merges.

        This fixes a few bugs in those language jobs
        that were preventing the post-merge run from terminating successfully.

        - `github_finalize` was missing a step to download the sources
        - `cargo_publish` was wrongly failing if `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` was
          empty
        - `npm_finalize` was failing because the test package publishing was
          conflicting with the flowzone package publish.

        This commit also adds a new github clean job, to remove any draft
        releases left behind after a PR is closed without merging.

        Since compose yaml files are often used for balena deployments,
        and optionally for docker compose tests, let's avoid overloading
        the file further and ignore it when looking for bake files.

        This should avoid a confusing mess of services to build when
        both compose files and bake files are present in a repo.

        Bake files used for docker build and deploy.
        Compose files used for docker compose tests and balena deploy.

        This commit replaces the Docker platform build/test matrix
        with a single docker-compose test. It also allows multiple bake
        targets for publishing image variants with unique tags.

        Currently only the linux/amd64 platform image will be tested
        with compose tests but any targets defined in the bake file(s)
        will be published as defined.

        The same cache scope is used for the compose tests as the publish
        steps so targets with long build times should need to build once.
        Additional cache sources can be added to the bake file(s).

        branch rules rather than apply all new ones.
