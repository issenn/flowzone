        Clippy needs to install repository dependencies before running. These

        dependencies may sometimes require external packages, which are provided

        by `cross` [pre-build hook](https://github.com/cross-rs/cross#pre-build-hook) feature.


        This PR changes the rust steps order so clippy is run using cross

        instead of default cargo.

        The test workflow will identify whether the PR is from a fork or not

        and we conditionally run either `pull_request` or `pull_request_target`

        events and skip the other to avoid duplicate workflows.


        Modifications to workflow files will be ignored for `pull_request_target`

        events by GitHub so we just need to make sure we aren't sharing secrets

        to arbitrary code.

        The `github_finalize` job was trying to use the original source of the PR

        for creating the release notes. This required the source artifact to

        exist at the moment of merge which is not always true as merge can

        happen at any point after creating the PR. This changes the job to use

        the latest source but exclude the last two commits (merge and version)

        from the release notes.

      body: >
        This may extend to more valid uses than intended, but for now we need

        to prevent merging PRs that have had master merged into them. This scenario

        will break versioning in master.


        The intended workflow at balena has always been to rebase PRs, so we have

        to continue to force this for now and avoid breaking merges.

      body: |
        This fixes a few bugs in those language jobs
        that were preventing the post-merge run from terminating successfully.

        - `github_finalize` was missing a step to download the sources
        - `cargo_publish` was wrongly failing if `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` was
          empty
        - `npm_finalize` was failing because the test package publishing was
          conflicting with the flowzone package publish.

        This commit also adds a new github clean job, to remove any draft
        releases left behind after a PR is closed without merging.

      body: |
        Since compose yaml files are often used for balena deployments,
        and optionally for docker compose tests, let's avoid overloading
        the file further and ignore it when looking for bake files.

        This should avoid a confusing mess of services to build when
        both compose files and bake files are present in a repo.

        Bake files used for docker build and deploy.
        Compose files used for docker compose tests and balena deploy.

      hash: e5e823e753b1ca5620d565c1525ec7e2f70c4a25
      body: |
        This commit replaces the Docker platform build/test matrix
        with a single docker-compose test. It also allows multiple bake
        targets for publishing image variants with unique tags.

        Currently only the linux/amd64 platform image will be tested
        with compose tests but any targets defined in the bake file(s)
        will be published as defined.

        The same cache scope is used for the compose tests as the publish
        steps so targets with long build times should need to build once.
        Additional cache sources can be added to the bake file(s).

        These inputs are prone to change and not fully tested, so
        remove them for now.
        Ideally we could get these values from a docker-compose or
        buildx bake file going forward.

        This input was very easy to break with formatting issues
        and did not take into account the fact that Flowzone job
        names may change.
        A suitable replacement should be considered to adjust the existing
        branch rules rather than apply all new ones.
